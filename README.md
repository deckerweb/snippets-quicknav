## How this Plugin Works

1. **Your Code Snippets in the Admin Bar**: various listings ‚Äì Active snippets, Inactive Snippets, by content/function type (PHP, HTML, CSS, JS, Cloud stuff), by tags
2. **Settings**: Direct links to relevant sections.
3. **Additional Links**:
	- _Snippets_: Code snippet libraries for WordPress by various authors, including the official Code Snippets Cloud
	- _Plugin ecosystem_: Links to resources like the Code Snippets website, Docs, Learning, Emergency fixes etc., plus Facebook group.
	- _About_: Includes links to the plugin author.
4. Support for Code Snippets Pro plugin version (premium); additional snippet types, settings, links etc.
5. Support for Code Snippets own "Safe Mode" (constant & filter function) ‚Äì extra notice in Admin Bar
6. Support for WordPress own "Script Debug" constant - extra notice in Admin Bar
7. Plugin supports Multisite behavior (and settings) of Code Snippets plugin itself and adapts the Toolbar links by context, if needed
8. Third-party plugin support/integration (currently: _Multisite Toolbar Additions_ by myself üòâ / _Variable Inspector_ by Bowo / _Debug Log Manager_ by Bowo)
9. Plugin installation mode:
	- a) As regular plugin (also supports Multisite network-wide activation)
	- b) As code snippet - directly in _Code Snippets_ itself! üëè
10. Custom tweaks via constants: enable or disable various additional features or tweaks ‚Äì just as simple code snippets, see below --- this keeps the plugin/snippet simple and lightweight
11. Show the Admin Bar also in Block Editor full screen mode.

## Custom Tweaks via Constants

### Default capability (aka permission)
The intended usage of this plugin is for Administrator users only. Therefore the default capability to see the new Admin Bar node is set to `activate_plugins`. You can change this via the constant `SNQN_VIEW_CAPABILITY` ‚Äì define that via `wp-config.php` or via Code Snippet plugin:
```
define( 'SNQN_VIEW_CAPABILITY', 'activate_plugins' );
```

### Name of main menu item
The default is just "Snippets" ‚Äì catchy and short. However, if you don't enjoy "Snippets" you can tweak that also via the constant `SNQN_NAME_IN_ADMINBAR` ‚Äì define that also via `wp-config.php` or via Code Snippet plugin:
```
define( 'SNQN_NAME_IN_ADMINBAR', 'Codes' );
```

### Snippets count ‚Äì addition to main menu item:
![With Counter -- Snippets QuickNav plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deckerweb/snippets-quicknav/master/assets-github/with-counter.png)
```
define( 'SNQN_COUNTER', 'yes' );
```

### Default icon of main menu item 
![Icon Alternatives -- Snippets QuickNav plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deckerweb/snippets-quicknav/master/assets-github/icon-alternatives.png)
The "snip" icon ‚Äì aka the scissor logo icon ‚Äì is awesome and really historic. However, you can use two other alternatives: 1) The Code Snippets company logo (a bit red-ish / blue-ish) or 2) a more neutral "code" logo from Remix Icon (free and open source licensed!). You can also tweak that via a constant in `wp-config.php` or via Code Snippets plugin:
```
define( 'SNQN_ICON', 'red_blue' );  // Code Snippets company logo
```
```
define( 'SNQN_ICON', 'remix' );  // code icon by Remix Icon
```

### Disable code snippets library items
Removes the "Find Snippets" section
```
define( 'SNQN_DISABLE_LIBRARY', 'yes' );
```

### Disable footer items (Links & About)
Removes the "Links" & "About" sections
```
define( 'SNQN_DISABLE_FOOTER', 'yes' );
```

### **Enable** "Expert Mode"
Nothing really fancy, just some additional links for coders:
- _Site Health Info_ (WP Core)
- Plugin: _Variable Inspector_ by Bowo
- Plugin: _Debug Log Manager_ by Bowo
```
define( 'SNQN_EXPERT_MODE', TRUE );
```
... support for _some_ additional stuff may come in future.

### **Fair Play:** Enable "free CS free" ‚Äì to remove some promo stuff ...
If you want the Pro promotions go away, use the following snippet ... or just purchase the Pro version to support the developers. Thank you in advance! (And thanks to the Code Snippets team for making this awesome tool for us site builders and developers!)
```
define( 'SNQN_FREE_CS_FREE', 'yes' );
```
- This removes the pro content types in the free version
- Removes the upgrade button, and upgrade submenu (in left-hand Admin menu)
- Removes Banner / survey on Code Snippet admin pages

## Plugin's Backstory

_I needed this plugin (Snippets QuickNav) myself so I developed it. Since Code Snippets was first released in 2012 I am using it and loving it. On some sites I have up to 20 or 30 snippets, small stuff mostly, but sometimes bigger also. For a long time, I have wanted a way to get faster to specific snippets to maintain those (for whatever reason). Since I have long history of Admin Bar (Toolbar) plugins I thought that would be another one I could make. In the last few weeks I felt the need to finally code something. So I came up with this little helper plugin / "snippet". And, scratching my own itch is also always something enjoyable. My hope is, that you will enjoy it as well (the finished plugin)._

## Plugin Scope / Disclaimer

This plugin comes as is.

_Disclaimer 1:_ So far I will support the plugin for breaking errors to keep it working. Otherwise support will be very limited. Also, it will NEVER be released to WordPress.org Plugin Repository for a lot of reasons (ah, thanks, Matt!).

_Disclaimer 2:_ All of the above might change. I do all this stuff only in my spare time.

_Most of all:_ Blessed (snippet) coding, and have fun building great sites!!! üòâ
